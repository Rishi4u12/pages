bio: >
  I am a detail-oriented CS student who thrives on completing tasks and meeting milestones. I excel at acting quickly on well-defined plans and finishing technical work, but can feel anxious when faced with uncertainty or creative ambiguity. I am motivated by clear guidelines and the satisfaction of a job well done, and I seek extra assurances to ensure my path to success.
